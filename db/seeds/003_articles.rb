                                        body: "A group of hippos - an unwanted legacy following the death of notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar - are being sterilised. Escobar, who was shot dead by police in 1993, illegally imported exotic animals, including a male and a female hippo - dubbed the 'cocaine hippos'. Since then, a growing population has been taking over the countryside near his former ranch, Hacienda Nápoles.  The Colombian government has so far sterilised 24 of more than 80 animals. They have been treated with a chemical that will make them infertile. Colombian environmentalists say the hippos, believed to be the biggest herd outside Africa, are an invasive species and have pushed away the native fauna. Many have campaigned for the animals to be culled or sterilised. Back in 1993, when authorities seized Hacienda Nápoles - Escobar's luxury estate situated about 250km (155 miles) north-west of the capital Bogotá - most of the animals found there were distributed to zoos across the country. But not the hippos. 'It was logistically difficult to move them around, so the authorities just left them there, probably thinking the animals would die,' Colombian biologist Nataly Castelblanco told the BBC earlier this year. However, with no natural predators in South America, the hippos multiplied. Hippos at Hacienda Nápoles, once the private zoo of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, in Colombia, 12 September 2020 According to experts, they started spreading through one of the country's main waterways - the River Magdalena. Scientists studying the hippos' environmental impact say the animals could affect the local ecosystem in a number of ways: from displacing native species already under threat of extinction, like the manatee, to altering the chemical compositions of waterways, which could endanger fisheries - though other studies suggest they might help the environment too. Escobar, one of the most notorious South American criminals of all time, was the founder of the infamous Medellín drugs cartel in the 1980s, responsible for kidnappings, bombings and indiscriminate assassinations. At one point he was thought to be one of the world's richest men.",

                                        lede: 'The government reveals its long-awaited strategy days beofre global leaders meet for COP26 in Glasgow.',
                                        body: "Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy. Ministers are investing £620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points. Car makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year. An extra £350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric. The new plan set out by the government is supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050. The announcement comes 12 days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change. Achieving net zero means the UK will no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather that threaten many forms of life. The UK has already made progress in cutting emissions compared to the levels released in 1990. In 2019, the country released 40% less than in 1990. On Tuesday the government also announced a strategy to address emissions from the UK's 30 million buildings. Homeowners will be able to apply for grants of up to £5,000 to install low-carbon heat pumps to replace gas boilers. The Labour party's Ed Miliband responded to the strategy, saying the 'plans falls short on delivery' adding 'we've waited months for a heat and buildings strategy, it's a massive let-down'. Prof Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the plan will require 'strong investment and innovation' and would generate a 'new and attractive form of growth. But he warned that low-income households will need support. And Prof Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at University of Bristol, called the strategy's approach to flying weak and unambitious.",

                                        lede: "Forget the pyramids, the canals of Venice or the Eiffel Tower – the Swedish government plans to make Sweden the world's top tourism destination by 2030.",
                                        body: "Forget the pyramids, the canals of Venice or the Eiffel Tower – the Swedish government has presented a plan to make Sweden the world's most attractive tourism destination by 2030 – but it's not yet clear how. In a press conference on Monday, Sweden’s Minister for Business, Industry and Innovation Ibrahim Baylan outlined the new strategy, which aims to make Sweden “the world’s most sustainable and attractive tourism destination built on innovation” by 2030. Baylan referred to Sweden as a country which “is usually ranked as one of the world’s most innovative countries”, which he argued can “create value for the tourism industry”. According to Baylan, the strategy builds on “sustainability’s three dimensions – it has to be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable”. The strategy will also “tie into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030”, he said. Topics covered by the new tourism strategy include the climate impact of tourism, equality and inclusion in the tourism industry and the importance of preserving shared resources such as national parks and sustainable nature tourism such as fishing and hunting. The press release highlights the importance of natural tourism, explaining that the pandemic has led to people visiting natural and cultural environments “to a greater extent than before”, increasing wear and tear to natural areas. Tourism is an important industry for Sweden, providing employment in both urban and rural areas, as well as generating wealth – before the coronavirus pandemic, the tourism industry represented on average 2.7 percent of Sweden’s GDP per year. The tourism industry also employs a high amount of people from foreign backgrounds – making up over a third (34 percent) of all employees in the industry. During the pandemic, overnight stays declined in almost every Swedish municipality, with the biggest declines seen in Sweden’s larger cities and border municipalitites. The government’s plans also include a focus on jobs and skill development, so that workers have the right qualifications for the industry – this reflects issues currently faced by the restaurant and hotel industry in finding skilled workers in the wake of the pandemic. There are currently no details as to how the government will achieve this strategy, or indeed how it will measure success. But Sweden is aiming high if it wants to be the world’s most attractive tourist destination by 2030. In 2019, it was ranked the 54th top tourist destination in the world by the UN World Tourism Organisation.",

                                        lede: 'An enormous new analysis of the wiring of the fruit fly brain is a milestone for the young field of modern connectomics, scientists say.',
                                        body: 'Once the simplest brain that actually does interesting, complex behavior,” Dr. Rubin said. Several different teams at Janelia have embarked on fly connectome projects in the years since, but the work that led to the new paper began in 2014, with the brain of a single, five-day-old female fruit fly. Researchers cut the fly brain into slabs and then used a technique known as focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy to image them, layer by painstaking layer. The microscope essentially functioned like a very tiny, very precise nail file, filing away an exceedingly thin layer of the brain, snapping a picture of the exposed tissue and then repeating the process until nothing remained. “Youre simultaneously imaging and cutting off little slices of the fly brain, so they dont exist after youre done,” Dr. Jayaraman said. “So if you screw something up, youre done. Your goose is cooked — or your fly brain is cooked.” The team then used computer vision software to stitch the millions of resulting images back together into a single, three-dimensional volume and sent it off to Google. There, researchers used advanced machine-learning algorithms to identify each individual neuron and trace its twisting branches. Finally, the Janelia team used additional computational tools to pinpoint the synapses, and human researchers proofread the computers work, correcting errors and refining the wiring diagrams. Last year, the researchers published the connectome for what they called the “hemibrain,” a large portion of the central fly brain, which includes regions and structures that are crucial for sleep, learning and navigation. The connectome, which is accessible free online, includes about 25,000 neurons and 20 million synapses, far more than the C. elegans connectome. “Its a dramatic scaling up,” said Cori Bargmann, a neuroscientist at the Rockefeller University in New York. “This is a tremendous step toward the goal of working out the connectivity of the brain.”\n Welcome to orientation\n Once the hemibrain connectome was ready, Dr. Jayaraman, an expert on the neuroscience of fly navigation, was eager to dive into the data on the central complex. The brain region, which contains nearly 3,000 neurons and is present in all insects, helps flies build an internal model of their spatial relationship to the world and then select and execute behaviors appropriate for their circumstances, such as searching for food when they are hungry. “Youre telling me you can give me the wiring diagram for something like this?” Dr. Jayaraman said. “This is better industrial espionage than you could get by getting insights into the Apple iPhone.” He and his colleagues pored over the connectome data, studying how the regions neural circuits were put together. For instance, Hannah Haberkern, a postdoctoral associate in Dr. Jayaramans lab, analyzed the neurons that send sensory information to the ellipsoid body, a doughnut-shape structure that acts as the flys internal compass. Dr. Haberkern found that neurons that are known to transmit information about the polarization of light — a global environmental cue that many animals use for navigation — made more connections to the compass neurons than did neurons that transmit information about other visual features and landmarks. The neurons dedicated to polarization of light also connect to — and are capable of strongly inhibiting — brain cells that provide information about other navigational cues. The researchers hypothesize that fly brains may be wired to prioritize information about the global environment when they are navigating — but also that these circuits are flexible, so that when such information is inadequate, they can pay more attention to local features of the landscape. “They have all these fallback strategies,” Dr. Haberkern said.\n Fruit fly phone home\n Other members of the research team identified specific neural pathways that seem well suited to helping the fly keep track of its head and body orientation, anticipate its future orientation and traveling direction, calculate its current orientation relative to another desired location and then move in that direction. Imagine, for instance, that a hungry fly temporarily abandons a rotting banana to see whether it can rustle up something better. But after a (literally) fruitless few minutes of exploration, it wants to return to its previous meal. The connectome data suggests that certain brain cells, technically known as PFL3 neurons, help the fly pull off this maneuver. These neurons receive two critical inputs: They get signals from neurons that track the direction the fly is facing as well as from neurons that may be keeping tabs on the direction of the banana. After receiving those signals, the PFL3 neurons then send out their own message to a set of turning neurons that prompt the fly to veer off in the correct direction. Dinner is served, again. “Being able to trace that activity through that circuit — from sensory back to motor through this complex intermediate circuit — is really amazing,” said Brad Hulse, a research scientist in Dr. Jayaramans lab who led this part of the analysis. The connectome, he added, “showed us a lot more than we thought it was going to.” And the groups paper — a draft of which includes 75 figures and stretches to 360 pages — is just the beginning. “It just really provides this ground truth for exploring this brain region further,” said Stanley Heinze, an expert on insect neuroscience at Lund University in Sweden. “Its just enormously impressive.” And just plain enormous. “I wouldnt really treat it as a paper but more as a book,” Dr. Heinze said. In fact, the paper is so large that the preprint server bioRxiv initially declined to publish it, perhaps because the administrators — understandably — thought it actually was a book, Dr. Jayaraman said. (The server ultimately did post the study, after a few extra days of processing, he noted.) The papers publication in the journal eLife “required some special permissions and back-and-forth with editorial staff,” Dr. Jayaraman added. \n Fly-ing lessons\n There are limitations to what a snapshot of a single brain at a single moment in time can reveal, and connectomes do not capture everything of interest in an animal brain. (Janelias hemibrain connectome omits glial cells, for instance, which perform all sorts of important tasks in the brain.) Dr. Jayaraman and his colleagues stressed that they would not have been able to infer so much from the connectome if not for decades of prior research, by many other scientists, into fruit fly behavior and basic neuron physiology and function, as well as theoretical neuroscience work. But the wiring diagrams can help researchers investigate existing theories and generate better hypotheses, figuring out what questions to ask and which experiments to conduct. “Now what were really excited about is taking those ideas that the connectome inspired and going back to the microscope, going back to our electrodes and actually recording the brain and seeing if those ideas are true,” Dr. Hulse said. Of course, one could — and some have — asked why a fruit flys brain circuitry matters. “I get asked this at the holidays a lot,” Dr. Hulse said. Flies are not mice or chimps or humans, but their brains perform some of the same basic tasks. Understanding the basic neural circuitry in an insect could provide important clues to how other animal brains approach similar problems, said David Van Essen, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis. Gaining a deep understanding of the flys brain “also gives us insights that are very relevant to the understanding of mammalian, and even human, brains and behavior,” he said. Creating connectomes of larger, more complex brains will be enormously challenging. The mouse brain contains roughly 70 million neurons, the human brain a whopping 86 billion.',

                                        lede: 'As the clocks change and the evenings get darker earlier, it is possible to brighten your outlook',
                                        body: 'As the clocks go back and evenings are doused in darkness, we all become wistful for long summer days, before settling into hunkering down for winter. But for around 3 per cent of the population who suffer from depressive moods triggered by seasonal affective disorder or SAD, the approaching months are filled with real despair.   "The feeling of dread sets in as soon as the days start getting shorter," says Kelly, 42, from Somerset. "I feel like an entirely different person in the summer compared with the winter. "In the winter, I become so sluggish and tired that I could sleep all day. I find it difficult to see any joy in anything. Everything seems bleak and helpless. Exercise helps, particularly getting outside in the daytime. Its hard to get going, but arranging to meet someone is a way to hold myself to account. As soon as the shortest day has passed, I know it wont be too long until I feel like my energetic self again."There is a difference between feeling down because of the weather and experiencing SAD, says Stephen Buckley, from mental health charity Mind. "Many people feel more cheerful and energetic when the sun is shining and the days are longer, but if you have SAD the change in seasons has a much greater effect on mood and energy levels, leading to symptoms of depression that have a significant impact on day-to-day life." Although it is not known exactly what causes SAD, steps can be taken to alleviate its symptoms, and is experts in mental and physical health, nutrition, exercise and more are here to offer their advice. \n Go for a walk in nature  \n While the causes of SAD arent always clear, we know that a lack of daylight can have a big impact on mood, especially during the autumn and winter months. When light hits the back of the eye, messages are passed to the part of the brain responsible for sleep, appetite, sex drive, temperature, mood and activity. If theres not enough light these functions are likely to slow down and gradually stop. The lack of daylight hours may also slow your body clock, making you feel more tired, and increase production of the hormone melatonin, which helps you get to sleep – both things may therefore link to depression. Going for walks, particularly around midday or on bright days, even if its just taking a short stroll, can be effective in reducing symptoms. Spending time in parks or gardens, or simply sitting near a window can also help. A light box that creates a bright white or blue light is also helpful to some. However, the evidence for them isnt reliable and they can be quite expensive, which means they arent an option for everyone, so spending more time in natural light is recommended. While you may not feel like it during the winter, physical activity can be very effective in lifting your mood and increasing your energy levels. It doesnt have to be anything particularly strenuous – doing housework, gardening or going for a gentle walk can all help. Research shows that outdoor exercise, such as cycling or jogging, can be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression. Bringing nature into your home can also help, and watering plants can create a feeling of accomplishment that may lift your mood. \n Eat a healthy, well-rounded diet  \n In winter, you might crave comfort foods such as sweets, chocolate, cakes and biscuits. But this way of eating will actually make the symptoms worse. Instead, eat lots of healthy fats, good quality protein, green leafy vegetables, fibre and complex carbohydrates. Try more wholegrain carbohydrates such as brown rice and brown pasta, which include more fibre and nutrients than the white varieties. Try making hearty meals such as a homemade bolognese with a sweet potato or brown rice instead of white pasta, or turkey ratatouille with mixed vegetables, or lean turkey, pure chopped tomatoes served with a mixed salad, or baked salmon with stir-fry broccoli, onion and cabbage. Holly Zoccolan, holistic lifestyle and nutrition coach \n Load up on vitamins and minerals \n Oily fish such as salmon, sardines and mackerel, eaten three times a week, provide good levels of the essential fatty acids EPA/DHA required for a healthy brain. Others with these fats – walnuts, dark green leafy vegetables and flaxseeds – have too little to have a therapeutic effect. Protein foods that provide a good supply of tryptophan (that converts to serotonin in the brain) are poultry, shrimps, tofu and eggs. But all protein foods supply some tryptophan, so eat a varied diet of meat and fish. Vitamin D3 must be supplemented by people living in the northern hemisphere, because we do not obtain sufficient UVB rays on our skin in winter convert to vitamin D. Butter, egg yolks and oily fish contain very small amounts, but not the 1000iu D3 that you need daily. Magnesium citrate is a useful supplement. Potential symptoms of low magnesium levels are cramps, constipation and headaches, although there could be other reasons for these symptoms, too. To know which foods and ways of eating work for you, listen to your body. If you feel sluggish, tired, and not firing all cylinders, then something in your diet is often not right. You may well be missing vital nutrients, your blood sugar levels might not be not balanced or you are consuming too many pro-inflammatory foods.   Caroline Peyton of Peyton Principles, nutritional therapist and naturopath \n Work on a positive mindset  \n Your brain doesnt know the difference between the narrative you tell it, and reality. If you focus on being miserable and trapped inside, your subconscious mind will focus on that. Try to spend five minutes at the start of every day writing down or speaking about everything you are grateful for, however big or small. You cant feel negative feelings when youre in a state of being grateful, even if its just a cup of great coffee or cosy sweater. Repeating positive affirmations will also help to reframe the way you think about yourself and stop negative self-talk. Stay sociable and connected  It can be tempting to hunker down and hide when the weather outside is bad and its dark by 4.30pm, but does that actually suit you? If seeing friends and family, going to the cinema, sporting events, the theatre and exhibitions or even just heading out for a meal once a week brings you joy, dont stop in winter. Pull on warm boots and a good coat and plan a normal social life. Even if you dont stay out late, having events in your diary will give your days and weeks structure and help you deal with winter. \n Lean into longer evenings \n When you do have an evening at home, is there anything you can do with that time that will give you a feeling of accomplishment? Its been shown that having something new and interesting to focus on wards off symptoms of SAD. Create photo albums of your summer holidays, redecorate a room in your house or clear out the cupboard thats become a dumping ground. An hour or two working towards a goal of ticking off jobs from a list will help you to relax and feel like you deserve to spend an evening on the sofa. Tara Best, neuro-linguistic programming coach and practitioner \n Lighten your workspace Being exposed to natural daylight is important – especially as many of us continue to work from home or adjust to a hybrid way of working. If possible, try making your working environment lighter and airier by opening more curtains and blinds. Like many people, I have brought a SAD lamp, because the bright light it produces positively affects my mood by lifting levels of hormones and neurochemicals. Simon Blake, chief executive of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England, which offers expert workplace guidance and training to support mental health \n Practise yoga \n Yoga has a positive impact on our nervous system, because controlled breathing and moving boosts oxygen flow through the body. (Illustration: Mark Long) Our bodies are designed to respond to changes in our environment. Research shows that yoga has a positive impact on our nervous system, because controlled breathing and moving boosts oxygen flow through the body. It also decreases your cortisol (the stress hormone), decreasing your anxiety and worry levels.  Yoga is something that can be done for as little as 10 minutes. There are so many styles to choose from. Whether you go for vinyasa or restorative, breathing is at the centre of every practice. It can help to cultivate presence, awareness and alignment.   The most powerful thing you can do is to focus on hip and heart openers, and really release the heart and sacral chakra. Our hips absorb physical and mental stress 24/7, which makes sense as they are located on our second chakra, the sacral, which is the centre of emotion, feeling, and connection. Therefore it is vital that we constantly give them the attention they deserve, the opportunity to release tension, tightness and any blockages. Think pigeon pose and crescent lunges that enable you to let go of what is no longer serving you, and welcome what does. This helps to remove and release negative energy, worries and fears, so that you can go about the rest of your day feeling rejuvenated, energised and aligned. Alexandra Baldi, yoga teacher and founder of Compass Chelsea \n Listen to music \n Music is a powerful tool that can be used to change your mood. Putting on some uplifting music can be an effective way to boost your mood if you are feeling down, particularly when paired with dancing and singing. ',

                                        lede: 'The cloud, hardware and competition are gaining in importance',
                                        body: 'The tech industry recently appeared to be sitting on cloud nine. One record after another fell when quarterly results were reported three months ago. Revenues had grown by 40% on average compared with the same period a year ago and profits by 90% for the five Western technology titans—Alphabet (Googles parent company), Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, collectively known as gafam. Indices of tech shares, such as the s&p 500 Information Technology benchmark, climbed to stratospheric heights. \n If the latest round of quarterly earnings are any guide, the tech industry is coming back down to earth. Assuming that the pair meet analysts expectations, gafams revenues and profits will both have increased but by a more modest 26% and 39%, respectively. Share prices are languishing. The slowdown—or breather, if you will—provides additional evidence of the degree to which the pandemic has changed the tech industry. The question now is whether the sector is on a new trajectory or will revert to type over the next few years. \n For starters, one of the first predictions when covid-19 hit in early 2020 was that it would make big tech even bigger. Those firms, ran the theory, would be best placed to benefit from an increased demand for digital offerings, whereas smaller firms, having fewer resources to get through the pandemic, would suffer most from its downsides. The first half of this prediction has come true: as the growth of the five firms market capitalisation shows. In January 2020 their combined value accounted for 17.5% of the S&P 500.Today their share hovers around 22%. \n That said, many smaller companies have also grown in size and value. The pandemic has given rise to a group which could be called “tier-two tech”, the weight of which, measured by market capitalisation, has grown notably relative to the titans. In May we defined this group to include 42 firms with a market value then of no less than $20bn that were incorporated in 2000 or later. In February 2020 these had a joint market capitalisation of 22% of gafams. Today the figure stands at 31%. \n The reasons for this new strength are multiple. One is the large number of listings of late, particularly of tech startups: more than 100 since the start of the year, says Renaissance Capital, a data provider. Despite some high-value deals, a backlash against big techs acquisitiveness has slowed the pace of mergers and takeovers this year. Most importantly, the pandemic has shown that there are big digital markets that are not dominated by gafam. The group of tier-two firms, for instance, is led by PayPal, a payments provider, that boasts a market capitalisation of $276bn. \n Yet the most intriguing shifts are qualitative. The first is that the tech industry has become far cloudier than previously. “We saw two years of digital transformation in two months,” said Satya Nadella, the boss of Microsoft, early in the pandemic, referring mostly to the growth of its cloud. Taken together, revenues of the three biggest clouds—Microsofts cloud business, Amazons aws and Google Cloud Platform, which between them provide more than 60% of online-infrastructure services—have surged by two-fifths from $27bn in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $38bn in the third quarter of this year. \n The gathering clouds bigger beneficiaries seem to be smaller firms, however. Taking a panel of 50-odd second-tier tech firms today, about four-fifths are providers of cloud services. Some are now forces to be reckoned with: Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform, is worth $104bn; Twilio, which provides corporate-communication services, some $61bn; and Okta, which manages employees digital identities, some $39bn. \n Older tech firms are now also more firmly anchored in the cloud. Salesforce, a software giant, was one of its pioneers. Adobe, another software titan, has successfully reinvented itself for this new form of computing. Even the clouds laggards, Oracle and sap, the worlds largest vendors of conventional corporate software, are at last making use of it. The biggest hardware-makers—Cisco, Dell and ibm—are also increasingly selling their wares “as-a-service”, accessed remotely through the cloud on a pay-per-use basis rather than installed on office computers. \n The industrys second shift is that lowly hardware has also made a comeback of sorts during the pandemic, despite the migration up into the computing skies. Most surprisingly, personal computers staged a revival as remote workers required better gear. In 2020 pcs saw their biggest growth in a decade, with more than 300m devices shipped, 13% more than in 2019, according to idc, a market-research firm. Growth has since slowed, but mainly because shortages of chips and other components are holding back production. Dell, the worlds third-largest maker of pcs after Lenovo and hp, has done best, increasing shipments in the third quarter by nearly 27% compared with last year, according to idc—almost guaranteeing good results when Dell reports on November 23rd. \n Chipmakers give an even stronger signal of the return of hardware to the industrys core. Although Intel disappointed investors when it released its quarterly results on October 21st, sending its share price down, sales were up by 5% to $19.2bn and profits by 60% to $6.8bn. Samsung Electronics, the worlds largest memory-chipmaker, which will also reported results on October 27th, saw its profits jump to the highest level in three years. And tsmc, the top contract manufacturer of semiconductors, for its part said on October 14th that sales had continued to grow at a rapid clip, reaching $14.9bn with net income coming in at $5.6bn, an increase of 16.3% and 13.8% respectively. \n The big question is whether the three companies can profitably follow through on their record-breaking investment plans. These are meant to satisfy growing demand for chips not just from cloud providers, but from firms making gear for what is called the “edge”: devices connecting to the cloud or extending it, from smartphones to intelligent sensors. Intel, for instance, has said that it will invest up to $28bn in 2022. tsmc plans to spend $100bn over the next three years to expand its chip-fabrication capacity. \n The third big change to the tech industry during the pandemic may be the most consequential: increased competition. Although members of gafam have yet to attack each others main franchises, such as online search in the case of Google and ecommerce for Amazon, rivalries have heated up. So far, vigorously competing clouds and changes in Apples privacy policies on the iPhone—which hurt Facebooks ad revenues according to results released on October 25th—are the main examples. But on October 21st Google announced that it would lower the fee it charges providers of subscriptions in its app store to 15%, putting pressure on Apple to do the same. And with so many people now working remotely and probably continuing to do so, a platform battle has broken out between Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Zoom, a popular videoconferencing service, over which will dominate the virtual office. \n Other firms are also picking more fights with gafam. Facebooks social-media fortress looks a lot less safe now that it has at least two serious rivals: Americas Snapchat, a social network owned by Snap, and TikTok, the short-video app operated by ByteDance, a Chinese internet giant. According to data divulged in a recent wave of leaks, Facebooks teenage users in America now spend two to three times longer on TikTok than on Instagram, which belongs to the American social-media conglomerate. Amazon also faces more competition, both in the form of incumbents that have at last embraced the digital world, including Walmart, and newcomers, such as Shopify, which helps merchants sell online and fulfil orders. PayPals attempt to buy Pinterest, another social network, now seems to have been abandoned, but it would have helped PayPal to move deeper into ecommerce. \n After nearly two years of covid-19 the tech industry is cloudier, more tied to hardware and more turbulent. Of these trends, the first two are unlikely to last for ever, at least in their current form. Digital meteorologists argue that the cloud has already reached “peak centralisation”, meaning that it will henceforth grow not so much through football-pitch-sized data centres, but at the “edge”, where its digital services touch the physical world. And given the economics of the semiconductor industry—fabrication plants often cost over $10bn and take years to build—the chip shortage could eventually turn into a glut. \n A more open question is how long the new phase of competition will last. Optimists argue that, after a long period of ossification, the pandemic has helped push the industry into a more dynamic period, in which the giants compete with each other as well as with smaller firms. Pessimists say that this phase will not last long—and that the industrys leaders will sooner or later shore up their fortresses and buy out competitors. And that is why, more than ever before, trustbusters should not let down their guard.',

                                        lede: 'England outclassed Australia in a memorable eight-wicket victory to close in on a place in the Mens T20 World Cup semi-finals.',
                                        body: 'Jos Buttler smashed a brutal 71 not out from just 32 balls as England raced to a target of 126 with 8.2 overs to spare. Eoin Morgans side dominated from the outset, reducing Australia - unbeaten in their two previous games - to 21-4 in Dubai. Chris Woakes removed David Warner and Glenn Maxwell and produced an outstanding one-handed catch to dismiss Steve Smith for one. Lower-order hitting and captain Aaron Finchs gritty 49-ball 44 took Australia before they were bowled out for 125 off the final ball. It was never likely to be enough. Buttler launched five huge sixes as the chase turned into a procession, the England-supporting contingent in the crowd singing and dancing in their seats. It was Australias heaviest T20 defeat in terms of balls remaining and maintained Englands perfect start to the tournament. They have three emphatic wins from three games and sit top of Group 1, with the top two progressing to the semi-finals. England play Sri Lanka in Sharjah on Monday before finishing the group with a match against South Africa at the same venue next Saturday. \n England humiliate oldest rivals \n Despite being ranked number one in the T20 rankings, even England would not have expected to have made such a perfect start to the World Cup. West Indies were bowled out for 55 and Bangladesh swatted aside with ease, but this win, against their oldest rivals, was utterly sensational. By the end, amid Buttlers extraordinary hitting, it looked as though the teams were playing sports from a different age. The opener peppered the top tier of the stands en route to a 25-ball fifty which included two sixes in two balls off pace bowler Starc. After the loss of Jason Roy for 22 and Dawid Malan for eight, Jonny Bairstow joined Buttler for the closing moments. When he launched two sixes of his own, captain Morgan was shaking his head in disbelief. Englands performance felt remarkably similar to their famous eight-wicket thrashing of Australia at Edgbaston in the semi-finals of the 2019 50-over World Cup. Continue this form and England could well back up that success and become the first mens side to hold both World Cups at the same time. \n A masterclass of T20 batting \n Former captain Michael Vaughan described England as "the best" and the "most destructive" team in the tournament. Asked for his reaction to the victory, a typically understated Morgan said. "Pretty good." England all-rounder Liam Livingstone was slightly more effusive. "We saw a masterclass of T20 batting from Jos," he said. "As clinical as it can be." Former Australia batter Stuart Law said: "It has been a horrible evening for Australia. "England have shown their class in this format. They are full of confidence and know their roles - and when you do that the game becomes very easy." \n Bowlers set England on their way \n As impressive as the chase was, England effectively won the match with early wickets. The seamers found movement under the Dubai lights and for the third match in a row England took two wickets in the opening three overs. Woakes removed Warner with his second ball - caught behind off a thin edge for one - and trapped Maxwell lbw for six in his second over. Between those wickets Woakes, leaping backwards at mid-on, held Smith off Chris Jordan, while Bairstow later took a good tumbling catch at long-off to cap another near faultless England fielding display. Jordan had Finch caught at long-off and bowled Pat Cummins for 12 with a perfect yorker to give him figures of 3-17, his best in a T20 for England since 2019. Liam Livingstone was effective too, conceding only 15 runs in four overs that also included the wicket of Matthew Wade. It was the complete England performance. \n “Buttler played a hell of an innings” - what they said \n England captain Eoin Morgan: "Jason was man of the match last time and showed that intent again here and then Jos followed suit and kicked on from there. "They set up the chase and made it quite comfortable in the end." Australia captain Aaron Finch: "England bowled well and put us on the back foot early, which is why they have been the best in the world for a while. "We had to bowl them out, no issues there, but Jos Buttler played a hell of an innings. It was just one of those nights."',

                                        lede: 'New Zealand returned to the top of the world rankings with a seven-try demolition of a depleted Wales.',
                                        body: 'Two tries from Beauden Barrett and further scores from TJ Perenara, Will Jordan, Dalton Papalii, Sevu Reece and Anton Lienert-Brown, plus 19 points from Jordie Barrett, sealed the win. Johnny Williams scored the only try for Wales, who were well beaten. And captain Alun Wyn Jones and Ross Moriarty joined the hosts extensive injury list. Jones - earning his 149th Wales cap and passing former New Zealand skipper Richie McCaws record total for one country - was forced off in the 18th minute after tackling Jordie Barrett. The injury was to Jones left shoulder - the same one he injured in the summer against Japan before recovering miraculously to lead the Lions in the three-Test series defeat against South Africa - and he was replaced here by Will Rowlands, with Jonathan Davies taking over the captaincy. \n Wales wait to beat All Blacks goes on  \n Defeat meant that Wales 68-year losing run against New Zealand continues. Not many were expecting a first victory over the All Blacks since 1953 and New Zealand eased away in the final quarter with some sublime tries orchestrated by man-of-the-match Beauden Barrett in his 100th international. New Zealand achieved their highest points total in Cardiff and equalled their highest winning margin in Wales. Wales were missing 20 players, with British and Irish Lions Ken Owens, George North, Leigh Halfpenny, Josh Navidi, Justin Tipuric, Dan Lydiate and Liam Williams absent through injury and Cardiff centre Willis Halaholo unavailable because of Covid-19. Wales also did not have access to their England-based club players Dan Biggar, Taulupe Faletau, Nick Tompkins, Louis Rees-Zammit, Callum Sheedy, Thomas Young and Christ Tshiunza, with the match being staged outside World Rugbys international window. In contrast, New Zealand fielded an almost full-strength side and came into the match having recently won the Rugby Championship and scoring 104 points against USA. The emphatic victory in Cardiff allowed New Zealand to leapfrog South Africa back to the world number one position. It was the first game at the Principality Stadium that could hold capacity crowds since February 2020 and the Welsh Rugby Union reported a sell-out of 74,500 for a game that raised £4m. \n 100 not out \n Fly-half Beauden Barrett, who became the 11th All Blacks player to achieve 100 caps, was in direct competition with Gareth Anscombe. The battle came 10 years after the pair had been team-mates in the New Zealand Under-20s side that defeated Wales 92-0 in the Junior World Championships. Anscombe, who qualifies for Wales through his mother, had battled back from a serious knee injury suffered against England in August 2019 that had ruled him out for two years. He had only played three league games before starting against the land of his birth here. It was a nightmare start for Anscombe, though, and a dream one for Barrett, who intercepted a pass from his opposite number to canter over - with his brother Jordie converting. Anscombe settled down with an opening penalty after good work at the breakdown from flanker Taine Basham on his first Wales start. A brilliant break from Aaron Wainwright from his own line released Owen Lane, whose inside pass to Johnny Williams was deemed to have been deliberately knocked on by Beauden Barrett. The New Zealand fly-half escaped a yellow card from French referee Mathieu Raynal. Wainwright was penalised for not rolling away, with Jordie Barrett restoring the seven-point advantage, then - after Wales captain Jones was forced off - adding a second penalty after New Zealand prop Nepo Laulala missed a try-scoring opportunity. With the roof open because of Covid-19 regulations and the rain beginning to fall heavily, the All Blacks prospered as scrum-half Perenara powered over. Despite New Zealands dominance, Basham stood out with his contact area turnover work and ebullient ball-carrying. Dragons back-row colleague Moriarty was forced off after a challenge from Laulala, who failed to wrap his shoulder and struck the Wales flanker on the head. Referee Mathieu Raynal decided it was not a red card, with Moriarty having dipped into contact and Ethan Blackadders tackle affecting Laulalas challenge, with the prop handed a yellow card. Moriarty was forced off and replaced by Cardiff lock Seb Davies. Wales woeful line-out continued to hamper them, though. Anscombe managed a second penalty to reduce the half-time deficit to 18-6 but Jordie Barrett added a further three points early in the second half. Rhys Priestland replaced Anscombe for his first international in four years and made an immediate impression by slotting over a penalty. Wales were punished for some loose kicking with Rieko Ioane and David Havili providing the warning before wing Jordan expertly counter-attacked to collect his own chip and cross for the All Blacks third try. Wales finally scored a try with Priestland producing a clever kick that centre Williams pounced on. The home side trailed by 12 points after 61 minutes but the All Blacks eased away with a devastating display of running rugby with four tries in the final quarter. New Zealand were ruthless with two tries in quick succession as flanker Papalii and replacement Reece powered over and the onslaught continued with a sixth score for centre Lienert-Brown. It was fitting Beauden Barrett sealed the win and took the score above 50 points with a second interception try, this time latching onto a loose pass from an otherwise impressive Johnny McNicholl. Wales challenges continue next weekend when world champions South Africa arrive in Cardiff. This autumn was never going to be easy. \n Wales: McNicholl; Lane, J Davies, J Williams, Adams; Anscombe, T Williams; W Jones, Elias, Francis, Beard, AW Jones (capt), Moriarty, Basham, Wainwright.  \n Replacements: Myhill for Elias (65), Carre for W Jones (56), Lewis for Francis (56), Rowlands for AW Jones (18), S Davies for Moriarty (36), G Davies for T Williams (68), Priestland for Anscombe (47), B Thomas for J Williams (68). \n New Zealand: J Barrett; Jordan, Lienert-Brown, Havili, R Ioane; B Barrett, TJ Perenara; Moody, Taylor, Laulala, Retallick, Whitelock (capt), Blackadder, Papalii, Savea. \n Replacements: Taukeiaho for Taylor (62), Tuinukuafe for Moody (62), Lomax for Blackadder (41-49), Lomax for Laulala (63), Vaai for Retallick (68), A Ioane for Papalii (68), Weber for Perenara (62), Mounga for Jordan (68), Reece for Havili (65).',
